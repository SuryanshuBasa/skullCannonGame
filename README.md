# skullCannonGame
## A simple 2-D skull cannon shooting game ##

GAME OVERVIEW =>
  -> This game consists of a cannon and a skull moving in a random path.
  -> The cannon is on the bottom of the game screen and the skull moves from left to right on top of the game screen.
  -> This game also has a reload component to the cannon so we have to place the cannon strategically and fire bullets wisely.
  -> Game runs for 100 seconds , +10 points are added for every hit to the skull.
  -> Skull has 10 lives so the game ends when the time hits 0 or when the skull lives deplete.
  
  HOW TO PLAY ON ANY DEVICE =>
    -> Since it is a C program and it runs on a C compiler it is recommended to use the IDE that i have used in order to run and play the code.
    -> This game has been coded using DEV C++ IDE.
    -> Link to download the IDE ->->https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/
    -> To run the game, place the 2 codes->GAME2.0.c and box.h in a same folder and open it from the IDE.
    -> Make sure the execution window display is in full screen to avoid any mismatch/disruption to the game mechanics.
  
  Possible Game improvements =>
    -> Adding modes to the game like:
                                    * No skull life mode to aim for high score.
                                    * And more which im working on.....
    -> Recording every players score and storing the high scores in a file and displaying the best
                                      scores at the end if the player wished to see it.
    -> Adding more creative modes to the game and improving on the basic game mechanics.
    -> Better CUI improvements and over all User/player playing experience.
